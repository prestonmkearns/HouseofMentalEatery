# HouseofMentalEatery
Techmecolor Community Project - #1

Purpose: House of Mental Eatery is local startup that is in need of a website. The members of Techmecolor have taken on this local small business with the purpose providing a nice web presence for the startup. 

This project is our first community project and the coding will be shared among the members of the group. Each person will work in a team so that members of this group can practice working on a team coding project.
